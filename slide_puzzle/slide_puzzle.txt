slide_puzzle takes an image and creates a 3x3 puzzle out of it.
To complete the puzzle, click on the piece you want moved to the empty square.
The piece must be adjacent to the empty square.
Once the puzzle is completed, a congradulatory message will appear on the screen.
Once this message is closed, the puzzle will automatically randomize itself again.

When selecting an image, the image must be stored in the proper folder.
A .jpeg or .png file must be selected as the image.
An image called 'test_image' has been placed in the correct folder, for convenience.
