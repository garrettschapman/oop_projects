huge_integer
Garrett Chapman

huge_integer manipulates integers of up to 40 digits, which is significantly larger than Java's int can handle.
It can add, subtract, and multiply these huge integers.

It accomplishes this task by creating arrays to house the information.

To use huge_integer, open HugeIntegerTest.java, and change the numbers present in the String[][] "testInputs".
